  <h3>Archives Page</h3>

  <p>
    Yellowblue provides you with an auto-generated Archives Page. You can see it by clicking on the menu's 'Archives' link in the demo site.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Archives page shows all the site's published posts, grouped by the publication year and sorted by the publication date.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Archives page is a feature of Yellowblue and you can use it right away. No plugins or extra configuration is needed. Just provide a link to <code class="language-markup">/archives</code> and the Archives page will be there for you!
  </p>

  <p>
    If you want to have a look at or modify the code of the Archives page, you can do it by opening the <code class="language-markup">archives/index.html</code> file.
