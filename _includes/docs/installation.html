  <h3>Installation</h3>

  <p>
    First of all, you need to have <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> installed in your machine (or virtual machine).
    In <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll's website</a>, you will find instructions on how to install Jekyll.
    Things should be fairly easy if your machine is a Mac or Linux based. For windows, Jekyll's site recommends <a href="http://jekyll-windows.juthilo.com/">this guide</a>. I have tested it and it works.

    The next thing to do, is to download the zip file containing the theme. Once you download it, open the archive and extract the folder named <strong>theme</strong>. Rename the folder if you wish to and then open the console and CD into it. Then type in the console <pre><code class="language-bash">jekyll serve</code></pre> Now open your browser and in the address bar, type <code>localhost:4000</code>
  </p>

  <p>
    Your new Jekyll site should load. Now you are ready to customize your site!

  	<h3>Jekyll version</h3>
  	<p>Yellowblue works well with Jekyll 2+. It's always a good idea to update your Jekyll gem, by typing in the console: <code class="language-bash">gem update jekyll</code></p>
