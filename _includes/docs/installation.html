  <h3>Installation</h3>

  <p>
    First of all, you need to have <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> installed in your machine (or virtual machine).
    In <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll's website</a>, you will find instructions on how to install Jekyll.
    Things should be fairly easy if your machine is a Mac or Linux based. For windows, Jekyll's site recommends <a href="http://jekyll-windows.juthilo.com/">this guide</a>. I have tested it and it works.

  <p>
    The next thing to do, is to <a href="https://github.com/chalatz/yellowblue/archive/master.zip"download the zip file>download the zip file</a> and extract its contents, or clone the <a href="https://github.com/chalatz/yellowblue">repository</a>. Either way, you will end up with a folder that contains the theme. Rename the folder if you wish to and then open the console and CD into it. Then type in the console <pre><code class="language-bash">jekyll serve</code></pre> Now open your browser and in the address bar, type <code>localhost:4000</code>
  </p>

  <p>
    Your new Jekyll site should load. Now you are ready to customize your site!

  	<h3>Jekyll version</h3>
  	<p>Yellowblue works well with Jekyll 2+. It's always a good idea to update your Jekyll gem, by typing in the console: <code class="language-bash">gem update jekyll</code></p>
