  <h3>CSS - SCSS</h3>

  <p>
    As from version 2, Jekyll provides <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/assets/">built-in support for Sass</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a> is CSS preprocessor, wich makes the life of a CSS author much, much easier. If you have never heard of Sass, please have a look at <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">its website</a> for more info.
  </p>

  <p>
    Yellowblue's Sass files are inside the <code class="language-markup">_sass</code> folder, which is Jekyll's default Sass folder. They are organized in two folders, <code>base</code> and <code>site</code>. Feel free to browse through these files. They also contain inline documentation to help you better understand the styling applied.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>It it strongly suggested not to edit the sass files.</strong> You may end up breaking something and then spend a lot of time to fix it.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can write your custom CSS / SCSS code in the <code class="language-markup">_sass/_custom.scss</code>. This file is imported last, which means that your changes will override any previously defined styles.
  </p>

  <p>
    You do not have to worry if you can write CSS but not SCSS. Just write your plain old CSS code in the <code class="language-markup">_sass/_custom.scss</code> file. Sass can understand and compile regular CSS code without any problems.
