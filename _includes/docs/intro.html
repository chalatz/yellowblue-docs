  <h3>Introduction</h3>

  <p>
    Hello and welcome to the docs for the <a href="https://github.com/chalatz/yellowblue" title="Yellowblue theme at Github">Yellowblue theme</a>!
  </p>

  <p>
    Yellowblue (YB) is a clean, modern, customizable, responsive theme, that will make your blogging a pleasant experience!
  </p>

  <p>
    YB is a Jekyll theme. Some basic Jekyll knowledge is assumed, although I try to be as detailed as possible and I also provide the appropriate documentaion links.
  </p>

  <p>
    Almost all of the documentation you will ever need for Jekyll, exists in the <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/">Jekyll's docs pages</a>, so feel free to explore the docs and play around with Jekyll.
