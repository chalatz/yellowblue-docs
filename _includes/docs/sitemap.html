	<h3>Sitemap</h3>

	<p>
		If you want your site's content to be known by search engines like Google, then it's a good idea to provide the search engine (I'll be referring to Google from now on) with a <code>sitemap.xml</code> file.
	</p>

	<p>
		Google has a set of <a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/">Webmaster Tools (GWT)</a> that can help your site have better results on Google's search results.
	</p>

	<p>
		Yellowblue auto genarates the <code>sitemap.xml</code> file for you, which you can submit to GWT. Here is <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/156184">an artricle from Google</a>, that explains what a sitemap is and why you may or may not need one.
	</p>

	<p>
		If your site's base URL is www.myblog.com, your sitemap's url will be <code class="language-markup">www.myblog.com/sitemap.xml</code>. In other words, to get your sitemap's URL, just append <code>sitemap.xml</code> to your sit's base URL.
	</p>

	<div class="alert-info">
		<div class="line1"></div>
		<div class="line2"></div>
		<h3>Do not forget!</h3>
		<p>
			Before deploying your site, do not forget to enter your site's base URL in the <code>url</code> variable in the <code>_config.yml</code> file!
		</p>
	</div>

	<p>
		If you want to have a look at the code that generates the sitemap, just open the <code class="language-markup">sitemap.xml</code> file.
	</p>

	<p>
		If you want to take control of the sitemap's variables, you can define them in your posts' or pages' Front Matter section, like so:
	</p>

<pre><code class="language-yaml">sitemap:
	lastmod: 2015-09-18
	priority: 0.7
	changefreq: 'monthly'
	exclude: 'yes'</code></pre>

	<p>
		The <code>exclude</code> variable is for pages, whereas the <code>published</code> variable is for posts. So if you don't want a page or a post to be included in the sitemap, just set the appropriate variable to <code>no</code>.
	</p>

	<p>
		If you omit the above section, the default values will be used, which are just fine.
	</p>
