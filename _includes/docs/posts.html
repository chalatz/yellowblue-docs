  <h3>Posts</h3>

  <p>
    The posts will be the heart and soul of your (and any) blog. Therefore, I have made an extra effort while writing the code for the posts.
  </p>

  <p>
    Yellowblue's posts, apart from the basic features, provide you with some extra features which make the overall navigating and reading experience, a pleasant and effortless process.
  </p>

  <p>
    Some of the posts' features, are:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Categories</li>
    <li>Tags</li>
    <li>Date of publishing</li>
    <li>Author</li>
    <li>Hero image</li>
    <li>Permalink (choose your own URL for your post)</li>
    <li>Comments (enable or disable at will)</li>
    <li>Navigation links to previous / next post</li>
    <li>Distraction free (the sidebar is not visible while on post pages)</li>
    <li>Edit the post's info for sitemap.xml. Choose if you want the post included in sitemap.xml or not.</li>
  </ul>

    <h4>↪ Writing Posts</h4>

    <p>
      Writing posts in Jekyll requires you to know a little about about <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/">Front Matter</a>. Don't worry though; even a quick read through <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/">Jekyll's documentation about Front Matter</a>, will get you up and running in no time.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now, the actual process of writing posts ia also <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/">very well documented</a>. Please make sure to read both about <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/">Front Matter</a> and <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/">writing posts</a>, in order to get a solid grasp on writing posts in Jekyll.
    </p>

    <p>
      The necessary variables for a post, are the layout, the title and the date. Below you can see a basic post:
    </p>

<pre><code class="language-yaml">---
layout: post
title:  "Welcome to Yellowblue!"
date:   2012-06-16 18:19:27
---
Post body goes here</code></pre>

  <p>
    Note that the post body can be written in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>, HTML, or even in both of them.
  </p>

  <div class="alert-info">
  	<div class="line1"></div>
  	<div class="line2"></div>
  	<p>The best way to get an idea about how posts are written, is to just check the theme's posts in the <code class="language-bash">_posts</code> folder.</p>
  </div>

  <h4>↪ Permalinks</h4>

  <p>
    <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/permalinks/">Permalinks</a> can be used in Yellowblue, as in any Jekyll site. Again, Jekyll provides <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/permalinks/">detailed documentation</a> about how to use permalinks. Just make sure that each post has a unique permalink!
  </p>

  <h4>↪ Hero images</h4>

  <p>
    If you have an image, say <code>my_hero_image.jpg</code> and want to use it as a hero image for your post, the first thing to do is copy the image into the <code class="language-bash">images</code> folder.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you want a lower resolution version of the image, say <code>my_hero_image_low_res.jpg</code>, to appear in the post's teaser place the image into the <code class="language-bash">images</code> folder.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you want the image to link to a larger image, place in the <code class="language-bash">images</code> folder a larger version of the image, say <code>my_hero_image_large.jpg</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
    A post with a hero image, will look like this:
  </p>

<pre><code class="language-yaml">---
layout: post
title:  "Welcome to Yellowblue!"
date:   2012-06-16 18:19:27
hero: images/my_hero_image.jpg
hero_high: images/my_hero_image_large.jpg
hero_low: images/my_hero_image_low_res.jpg
hero_alt: My Hero Image
---
Post body goes here</code></pre>

  <p>
    As you can see, the variables regarding hero images, are the following:
  </p>

  <div class="table-container">
			<table class="pure-table pure-table-bordered">
			    <thead>
			        <tr>
			            <th>Variable</th>
			            <th>Value</th>
			        </tr>
			    </thead>
			    <tbody>
			        <tr>
			            <td>hero</td>
			            <td>The path to the image file</td>
			        </tr>
			        <tr>
			            <td>hero_high</td>
			            <td>The path to the image file of a high resolution version. The image will be used as a link from the original hero image.</td>
			        </tr>
			        <tr>
			            <td>hero_low</td>
			            <td>The path to the image file of a low resolution version. The image will be used in the post teaser.</td>
			        </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>hero_alt</td>
                <td>The alternative text to the image. It will be included in the images markup.</td>
              </tr>
			    </tbody>
			</table>

    <h4>↪ Comments</h4>

    <p>
      Yellowblue uses <a href="https://disqus.com/">Disqus</a>, a widely popular comments service. In order to you use it, you have to create an account there.
    </p>

    <p>
      By default, comments in the YB theme are disabled and you get to determine if a post will accept comments or not.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you want to have the comments enabled by default, just head over to <code class="language-bash">_config.yml</code> and change the line <code class="language-bash">comments: false</code> to <code class="language-bash">comments: true</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you want to have the comments disabled by default, but you want to choose which posts will allow comments, just add the line <code class="language-bash">comments: true</code> in your post's Front Matter section.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you want to have the comments enables by default, but you want to choose which posts will not allow comments, just add the line <code class="language-bash">comments: false</code> in your post's Front Matter section. Also make sure that in <code class="language-bash">_config.yml</code> the <code>comments</code> variable is set to <code>true</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The code for the comments resides in <code class="language-bash">_includes/comments.html</code>. The code is provided by Disqus and the comments (for the code) are quite explanatory. All you need to change, is the Disqus username. Yelloblue's username is <code>yellowblueeu</code>, so all you have to do in the following piece of code:
    </p>

    <pre><code class="language-javascript">var disqus_shortname = 'yellowblueeu'; // required: replace example with your forum shortname</code></pre>

  <p>
    is to change <code>yellowblueeu</code> with your own Disqus username. And that's it. Now your site can support comments!
