  <h3>The Grid</h3>

  <p>
    Yellowblue features a simple, responsive, mobile-first grid system.
  </p>

  <p>
    Its basic functionality is that each row is inside a container with a class of <code class="language-markup">row</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then, if you want your content to have a length of a full row, just place a container with a class of <code class="language-markup">full-width</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you need two columns, place two containers, each with class of <code class="language-markup">half-width</code>. If you need three columns, place three containers, each with class of <code class="language-markup">one-third-width</code>. If you need four columns, place four containers, each with class of <code class="language-markup">one-fourth-width</code>.
  </p>

  <div class="alert-info">
  	<div class="line1"></div>
  	<div class="line2"></div>
  	<p>Notice that I am referring to <span class="italic">containers</span> and not, for instance, divs. That's because the classes of the grid system can go with any block-type HTML tag, like divs, sections, paragraphs, etc. </p>
  </div>

  <p>
    The best way to understand the grid system, is to have a look at it at the Pattern Library demo page. There you will get a visual understanding of the grid, along with its code.
