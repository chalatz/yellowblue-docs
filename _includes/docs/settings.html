  <h3>Site Settings</h3>

  <p>
    Everything regarding your site's global configuration, is found in one single file; <code class="language-bash">_config.yml</code>
  </p>

  <p>
    Most of the variables there are pretty much self explanatory, i.e the <code>title</code> sets the site's title, the <code>email</code> sets the site's email, etc.
  </p>

  <p>
    For a full listing of what you can do with the site's configuration, check <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/">Jekyll's Configuration docs page</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    YB uses a couple of extra settings, like <code>paginate</code> and <code>excerpt_separator</code>. The <code>paginate</code> variable sets the number of posts teasers per page and the <code>excerpt_separator</code> sets the end of the post teaser. More on these variables, can be found at their corresponding sections in the docs.
